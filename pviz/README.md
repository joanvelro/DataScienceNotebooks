How to solve visualization problems with Python tools
=====================================================

This repository provides examples, demos, and training materials
documenting how to solve visualization problems using Python
tools that work with web browsers, including
`Bokeh <https://bokeh.pydata.org>`_,
`HoloViews <https://holoviews.org>`_,
`GeoViews <http://geoviews.org>`_,
`Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_,
`Datashader <https://github.com/bokeh/datashader>`_, and
`Param <https://github.com/ioam/param>`_.

It includes a shared conda environment that ensures all these tools work together,
facilities for downloading sample data for use with these tools, and provides
starting points for solving your own visualization problems.


Installation
============
